# micro-http

A tiny static file server written in C, with functionality similar to Python's SimpleHTTPServer. Presents a file listing for directories. Handles multiple requests asynchronously.

* Build by running `make` or `make serve`.

* Add `serve` to your `$PATH`. 

* Run `serve 9000` to serve the current working directory. Visit localhost:9000.
